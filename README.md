The model is defined in the file ```bayesecm_model.stan``` and used in the corresponding R script found from ```bayesecm_model.R```. The data used is in the file ```par.rds```, which is read into R in the file ```bayesecm_model.R```. The data includes the monthly rye prices in log-scale from January 1861 to December 1869, and each row corresponds one region and the rownumber the id number of that region. Also the neighbourhood matrix is included.
